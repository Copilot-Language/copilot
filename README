Copilot: A (Haskell DSL) stream language for generating hard real-time C code.

Can you write a list in Haskell? Then you can write embedded C code using
Copilot. Here's a Copilot program that computes the Fibonacci sequence (over
Word 64s) and tests for even numbers:

fib :: Streams
fib = do
  let fib = varW64 "fib"
  let t   = varB "t"
  fib .= [0,1] ++ fib + (drop 1 fib)
  t   .= even fib
    where even :: Spec Word64 -> Spec Bool
          even w' = w' `mod` 2 == 0

Copilot contains an interpreter, a compiler, and uses a model-checker to check
the correctness of your program. The compiler generates constant time and
constant space C code via Tom Hawkin's Atom (thanks Tom!). Copilot was
originally developed to write embedded monitors for more complex embedded
systems, but it can be used to develop a variety of functional-style embedded
code.

Release notes

* Copilot-0.26
  * Variables are now specs, not strings.  This gives stream expressions a type,
    so no need for constant functions, monomorphic cast functions, or var
    annotations in expressions.  Examples updated to reflect the change.

* Copilot-0.25

  * Added true, false Specs (Spec Bool)
  * Removed generic const -- unneeded, since Spec instantiates Num.
  * Change casting to only allow casts that (1) are guaranteed not to change the
    sign and (2) are to a larger type.
  * Removed libs from Copilot.hs.  You must import these explicitly.
  * Fixed buts with LTL and ptLTL libraries and examples and added documentation.

* Copilot-0.24

  * Fixed a bug in external array analysis for computing the minimum period
    size.
  * Added the ability to specify a HW clock for Atom.

* Copilot-0.23

  * All -Wall warnings removed (from importing Copilot.hs).
  * Added support for sampling external array values.  (See Examples.hs).
  * Fixed a bug in calling CBMC to ensure it unrolls it's loop.  Updated
    documentation in Help.hs.
  * Other minor stylistic changes and fixes.

* Copilot-0.22: initial release
