-- | Given a stream, produce an infinite list of streams dropping an increasing

-- | Given a stream and a number, produce a finite list of streams dropping an
-- increasing number of elements of the given stream, up to that number. For
-- example, for a given stream @s@, the expression @take 2 s@ is equal to
-- @[ drop 0 s, drop 1 s]@.
