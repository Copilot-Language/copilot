--
-- Bounded Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) operators. For a bound @n@, a property
-- @p@ holds if it holds on the next @n@ transitions (between periods).  If
-- @n == 0@, then the trace includes only the current period.  For example,
--
-- @
--   eventually 3 p
-- @
--
-- holds if @p@ holds at least once every four periods (3 transitions).
--
-- /Interface:/ See @Examples/LTLExamples.hs@ in the
-- <https://github.com/leepike/Copilot/tree/master/Examples Copilot repository>.
-- 
-- You can embed an LTL specification within a Copilot specification using the
-- form:
--
-- @
--   operator spec
-- @
--
-- For some properties, stream dependencies may not allow their specification.
-- In particular, you cannot determine the "future" value of an external
-- variable.  In general, the "Copilot.Library.PTLTL" library is probably more useful.

-- | Property @s@ holds at the next period.  For example:
--
-- @
--           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
-- s      => F F F T F F T F ...
-- next s => F F T F F T F ...
-- @
-- Note: s must have sufficient history to 'drop' a value from it.

next = drop ( 1 :: Int )


-- | Property @s@ holds for the next @n@ periods.  We require @n >= 0@. If @n ==
-- 0@, then @s@ holds in the current period, e.g., if @p = always 2 s@, then we
-- have the following relationship between the streams generated:
--
-- @
--      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
-- s => T T T F T T T T ...
-- p => T F F F T T ...

-- | Property @s@ holds at some period in the next @n@ periods.  If @n == 0@,
-- then @s@ holds in the current period.  We require @n >= 0@.  E.g., if @p =
-- eventually 2 s@, then we have the following relationship between the streams
-- generated:
--
-- @
-- s => F F F T F F F T ...
-- p => F T T T F T T T ...

-- | @until n s0 s1@ means that @eventually n s1@, and up until at least the
-- period before @s1@ holds, @s0@ continuously holds.

-- including the period at which @s0@ becomes true.
